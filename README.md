# NaturalComputing
This is the GitHub repository of group 22 for the course Natural Computing

Each week is stored in its own folder.


## Week 1 and Week 2
This week, we will be using Jupyter Notebook:

To download Jupyter Notebook, follow the following guide: 
https://jupyter.org/install

Download the files of the correct week.

To open Jupyter Notebook, open a terminal and type in
```jupyter notebook```
This will allow you to open notebooks in a browser.

## Week 3

This week, we used HTML and Javascript. The HTML files can just be opened in a browser, but ```artistoo.js``` (from github.com/ingewortel/artistoo) and ```fpsmeter.min.js``` (from github.com/darsain/fpsmeter) are required to be in the same folder. 

## Week 4

This week we again used Jupyter Notebook, together with bash files which run commands on the provided software. For the Classifying Languages part, the provided files should be stored in the folder `./lang`. The files for the (from the syscalls subdirectories) should be stored in the same directory as the notebook and the bash files.
