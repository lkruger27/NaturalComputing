# NaturalComputing
This is the GitHub repository of group 22 for the course Natural Computing

Each week is stored in its own folder.


## Week 1 and Week 2
This week, we will be using Jupyter Notebook:

To download Jupyter Notebook, follow the following guide: 
https://jupyter.org/install

Download the files of the correct week.

To open Jupyter Notebook, open a terminal and type in
```jupyter notebook```
This will allow you to open notebooks in a browser.

## Week 3

This week, we used HTML and Javascript. The HTML files can just be opened in a browser, but ```artistoo.js``` (from github.com/ingewortel/artistoo) and ```fpsmeter.min.js``` (from github.com/darsain/fpsmeter) are required to be in the same folder.
